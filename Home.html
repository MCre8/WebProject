<h1> About Me </h1>

<img src="media/Profile.png">

<p> Hello! My name is Mia, and I am an Art and Computer Animation student. <br></p>

	

	<p> Storytelling and art have always been a big part of my life. When I was younger, I loved watching the behind the scenes of my favorite movies and TV shows. I wanted to be a part of making an incredible story for everyone to enjoy. The whole reason I got into drawing was because I wanted to create my own stories and adventures.</p>
	<p> It started off with comics I colored in and lamenated (with the help of my Mom), then stapled together. It progressed into taking more of an interest in school writing assignments. When I was in high school, my Mom found me a course entitled 'How to Write a Novel'. With it, I progressed in my story-building knowledge, and dually took drawing and human anatomy classes online.
	<p> Now a full-time college student, I am steadily working towards my dream of working as a Junior Animator and Freelance Illustrator, where I hope to create wholesome entertainment for everyone to enjoy. As an Autism sibling, I also plan to create informational videos geared towards helping people on the Autism spectrum. </p>
